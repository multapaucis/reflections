What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git init creates the repository for you to use. it creates a hidden folder, .git.
.Git stores all of the repository data
The only thing necessary to create a repository is to change directory to the folder you want to create it in and enter git init

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
    What value do you think it offers?

    the staging area allows you to select certain files to add to the repository.
    This way you don't have to commit all your files or just 1 at a time
