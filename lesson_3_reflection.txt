1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Remote Repositories are ideal for Sharing. There are some other benefits such as non-local backup, and being able to access from multiple devices, but the main appeal is being able to share the product or share the work load.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Just because a logical change has been made, doesnâ€™t mean it is ready to go public. It also helps for group projects so you can make sure everything can go at once.
